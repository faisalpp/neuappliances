This may create a larger width requirement.',"Consider, if the door of the refrigerator will protrude past your cabinets or sits flush or behind with the cabinets. If the refrigerator door sits flush or behind the cabinets, it may require a smaller width refrigerator to fully open the doors properly.","If there is a wall on one or both sides of the refrigerator this may also limit the door swing and requires a smaller width refrigerator to access your refrigerator contents. Many refrigerators doors need to be open up to 120 degrees or more to open bins or pullout crisper shelving. We see this measurement play an important role on counter depth refrigerators. If the refrigerator door is behind or flush with the cabinetry then, it will limit the available width to open the doors depending on the door swing. Sometimes this results in the need to pull the refrigerator out past the countertop to open the doors and may remove the desired appearance of having a counter depth refrigerator."]})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-6",children:[e.jsx(t,{bgcolor:"bg-b21",title:"Refrigerator Door Swing Depth",description:["The depth of the refrigeratorâ€™s door swing is also an important measurement.
