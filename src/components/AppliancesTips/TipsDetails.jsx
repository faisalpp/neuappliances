                        <p className='leading-7 sm:leading-8 tracking-[-0.32px]'>
                            Refrigerators have oil and refrigerant in the same sealed system. When a refrigerator is moved sometimes the oil in the compressor can work its way up inside the lines. Leaving your refrigerator stationary for 4 hours gives the oil time to return back to the compressor. This is also why you should never lay a refrigerator down or on its side.

                            On most refrigerators there is a switch located on the ice maker or on a display to turn the ice maker on / off. If you choose not to use the ice maker turn it off here even if the water is turned off. If you want to use the ice maker make sure this switch stays on. Some refrigerators have an ice level bar that switches the ice maker off, move this to the off position if you do not want to use your ice maker.

                                Always, Always, Always leave your refrigerator on “Factory Settings”. A majority of refrigerators display near the controls what the “Factory Settings” is. If your refrigerator does not, set right the temperature to the middle setting if it is a analog dial. If your refrigerator is digital set to 0 degrees in the freezer and 32 in the refrigerator. With a single evaporator refrigerator, the evaporator coil that produces the cold air is generated in the freezer and sent to the refrigerator with a series of fans, vents or damper doors (openings). Changing the settings will adjust the cooling cycle duration and the ventilation openings. If your refrigerator and freezer are set too far apart (one low and one high), when the different temperature airs meet in the air passage way they will form condensation. That condensation will freeze and build up ice and eventually block air from pass through. Avoid this by setting your appliance to the factory settings.

                                You have a little more leniency on varying settings on the dual evaporator refrigerators. There typically aren't shared air passageways that are shared between the freezer or fridge to freeze over. However your refrigerator is designed to perform at the factory settings.

                        <p className='leading-7 sm:leading-8 tracking-[-0.32px]'>
                            Condenser coils are the coils on the back or bottom of the refrigerator outside of the refrigerator. (Evaporator coils are located inside.) Refrigerators need clean condenser coils to expel heat properly. When these coils get dusty or dirty it makes it difficult for your refrigerator to cool properly. It will have to work harder for the same result or sometimes it can hinder the cooling ability of the fridge completely. Cleaning these coils yearly will help keep your refrigerator cooling properly. In most refrigerators the condenser coils are located towards the bottom on the back of the refrigerator. Unplug your refrigerator and simply vacuum or brush off the dirt or dust gently.

                            Amazon is a great place to purchase water filters. Make sure to match the model number of your refrigerator to the water filter as filters vary between different models.

                        <p className='leading-7 sm:leading-8 tracking-[-0.32px]'>
                            There is nothing worse than coming home to a warm fridge because of a tripped GFI outlet. GFI outlets work by monitoring the amount of current flowing from hot to neutral. If there is an imbalance, it trips the circuit. Many refrigerators can consume a small amount of electricity naturally which can cause these to trip. Never plug a freezer or a refrigerator into a GFI Outlet!
